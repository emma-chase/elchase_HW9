This project aims to collect data about Business Analytics students. The survey gains insights into where these students are from, their year in school, and what their favorie classes are.

Best Form Practice

This form was created with best practices in mind throughout. The form begins with a very clear and consise cover page. The title is larger than other text so that users are quickly drawn to read it. This page was also styled using bootstrap, ensuring the page looked clean. The next page asks the user demographic information. Autofocus was utilized to ensure users' curser is initially placed on the first box. This reduces friction within the form. On the second box, there is a tooltip that clarifies what the question is asking. This is there to prevent any user from getting confused when filling out the form. I have made the necessary questions required so that users can't move on without answering the question. The next page asks about year in school and classes that the individual has completed. The classes question was well created because it allows users to select multiple options. At the bottom of the page, users know that they are done with the survey because it says page 2/2. The final page thanks the users for taking the survey. It is good practice to let those taking a survey know that it has been saved; this page does this.

In general, I utilized bootstrap throughout each page. Utilizing the same styling platform allows the form to look uniform and cohesive. I also worked to make sure the text was appropriately sized and spaced out. 

Accessibility

This web page is compliant with WCAG, as it passes the WAVE accessibility tool test. I made sure to keep accessibility at the forefront of my mind while making this form. The image at the end has alternative text so if someone is blind, it will be read to them. Additionally, the form doesn't rely on sensory characteristics to complete. The primary colors of the form are blue and black which are good colors to use in the case of color blind users.
